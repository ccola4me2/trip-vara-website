// Did a fix cross the fork, or only half of it?
//
// cttagents and trip-vara are the same portal with different names on it. Most
// of src/ is identical, and the two drift a file at a time: something is fixed
// on one side and the other is never told. That has cost real bugs. The Clients
// page on trip-vara threw on load from the day households shipped, because the
// script crossed and the markup did not. proposals.js crossed without the
// migration its columns needed, so every sent proposal was filed under "nobody
// opened it" and an advisor was advised to send it again.
//
// Text diffing the two is useless: it is dominated by the word CTT against the
// words Trip Vara, a logo extension, a bucket name. So this compares what each
// side *declares* rather than what it says, which drops comments and titles for
// free.
//
// One rule fails the build, and it is deliberately narrow: two shared modules
// must export the same surface. An export is the contract between files, and a
// module that has grown or lost one on a single side is a port that stopped
// half way. Everything else is printed as a report for somebody about to port
// something, and fails nothing, because pages legitimately differ and a rule
// that is mostly exceptions is worse than no rule.
