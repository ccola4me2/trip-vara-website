// Does anything read the boxes people type into?
//
// A form field is a name on a page and a property read on the server, and
// nothing connects the two. Rename one side, or add a field and forget the
// other half, and the box appears, accepts what somebody types, saves without
// complaint and throws the value away. No error, no log line, no failing
// request. The field is simply always empty afterwards, and it is found weeks
// later by somebody wondering why a value they typed will not stay typed.
//
// That has happened here twice at the layer below this one, where a column was
// missing from a statement rather than a field from a handler. check-columns
// and check-writes guard those. This is the same failure one step up.
//
// So: every name="..." on a page must be read somewhere in src/ as body.<name>
// or raw.<name>, or be listed below with the reason it is not.
