// Is the migration sequence unambiguous?
//
// This exists because of a real outage, and the outage was invisible for days.
//
// The CTT fork of this codebase reached 0054 at the same time this repo did,
// so it ended up holding 0054_itinerary.sql beside 0054_session_acting_as.sql,
// and the same again at 0056 and 0057. Nothing complained. The files sort, the
// schema builds, every check passed.
//
// It happened downstream rather than here, and it happened because this repo
// keeps numbering while a fork does too. The next fork will do the same, and
// the check costs nothing.
//
// What broke was the part no script was watching: a person applying migrations
// by hand reads the numbers, applies "up to 58", and never notices that three
// numbers had two files each. Three migrations were skipped. Weeks later the
// bookings table was missing two columns, every call to /api/bookings answered
// 500, and the symptom that reached anybody was a Status dropdown on the new
// reservation form that would not open.
//
// So the rule is that a number belongs to one migration. It is not about
// ordering, which happens to survive on filename sort; it is about a human
// being able to say which migrations they have applied.
