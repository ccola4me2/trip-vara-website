// Does every money total know about the soft twin?
//
// A final balance is two rows in booking_payments. The hard row is the
// vendor's deadline. The soft row is this portal's own reminder to chase the
// same money a week earlier. They are one obligation stored twice, which is a
// good design for chasing and a trap for arithmetic: any total that sums both
// reports a $2,000 balance as $4,000.
//
// That trap was walked into five times in one day on the CTT fork, which
// shares this codebase: the reservation tile, the payments table, the payments
// stat tiles, the sales board and the dashboard's Passed tab. Two of those
// screens exist here and carried the same bug. Each was fixed where it was
// found and the next turned up on the screen next door, because fixing
// instances of a rule nothing enforces is how you keep fixing it.
//
// So the rule is written down here. A SUM over booking_payments.amount_cents
// names payment_class, or it appears below with a reason somebody thought
// about.
