// widen to the whole agency when an owner asks, and every write is confined to
// the caller. Both halves live in the same helpers (scopeWhere, selfScope), so
// the failure mode is not a wrong scope but a missing one: a query written
// without any user predicate at all, which quietly returns or changes
// everybody's rows and looks perfectly normal in testing on one account.
//
// Nothing else catches it. The smoke test signs in as two people and checks
// what each can see, which covers the endpoints somebody thought to test; this
// covers every statement in the codebase, including the ones added since.
//
// A statement touching a table that belongs to a user must name user_id, or
// interpolate one of the scope helpers, or be listed below with a reason.
// "It is only ever called with an id we already checked" is a reason, and it
// has to be written down rather than assumed.
