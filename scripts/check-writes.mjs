// Do two full-record saves of the same table agree about its columns?
//
// A table usually has one statement that writes the whole record. When it has
// two, they should set the same fields, and when they do not, one of them is
// almost always missing something rather than deliberately leaving it out.
//
// That is not a guess. handleUpdateClient wrote every field on a client except
// nickname and source, which upsertClient a hundred lines above it did write.
// Nothing failed: the write succeeded, the columns were simply not in the
// statement, and the value came back unchanged. You could record what somebody
// went by when you first added them and never correct it, and "where they came
// from" was the same field, which is the only one that answers which of your
// marketing is working.
//
// check-columns exists for this failure and reads SELECT lists, so it had
// nothing to say about an UPDATE. This is the other half.
//
// Only statements setting eight columns or more, because that is what makes
// one a full-record save rather than a stamp on one field. updated_at is
// ignored for the same reason a comma is.
