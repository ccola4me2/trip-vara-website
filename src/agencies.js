// Agencies, and what each one looks like.
//
// The portal ran as one business for as long as there was one. An agency is
// now a row, and it does two jobs that used to be done badly or not at all.
//
// It is the fence. Before this, an owner saw every advisor on the platform,
// and could suspend or re-split any of them, because the handlers checked that
// the caller was an owner and never which agency they owned. That was fine
// while the answer was always "this one".
//
// And it is the name over the door. The agency name and address were copied
// onto every advisor, so two people at one agency could disagree about what it
// was called, and the public pages a client sees said Trip Vara whoever sent
// them.
//
// Two kinds of owner. `role` is unchanged and still means the owner of one
// agency. The platform operator, who can see across agencies and create them,
// is a separate flag: a third value in a field that fourteen places already
// test against would have changed what all fourteen mean.
