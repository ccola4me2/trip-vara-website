// point: whichever module the bundler reaches second gets a binding that is
// still in its temporal dead zone, and sign-in throws.
//
// So the reads live here and import nothing. The handlers live in agencies.js
// and import this.

/**
 * Dark enough to read, and to be read on.
 *
 * The agency's colour is not a decoration. On a client's trip page it paints
 * every heading, the departure and return dates, the cabin, the confirmation
 * number, and a badge that writes white text on top of it. On the join page it
 * paints the header band and every field label. Nothing has ever checked that
 * somebody can see any of it.
 *
 * So an agency owner who types a pale brand colour, and a gold or a sky blue is
 * an ordinary thing for a travel agency to have, publishes a trip page whose
 * dates and cabin number are not legible and whose badge is white on cream.
 * Their clients get it, and nobody in the agency is looking at that page.
 *
 * The test is the WCAG AA contrast ratio against white, 4.5:1, which is what
 * the rest of both palettes is built to. A colour that fails keeps the portal's
 * own, and the agency still gets its name, its logo and its tagline on every
 * page: unbranded and readable beats branded and not.
