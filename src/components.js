// A cruise with air on it used to go in as one reservation with a component
// hanging off it for the air: its own vendor, its own confirmation number,
// its own dates, and its charges tagged onto the same pricing grid. It worked
// and it cost more than it saved. The grid had to be switched from one vendor
// to another, an option had to say which part of the trip it belonged to, and
// the commission on the air was chased on the cruise's row. Two vendors is
// two reservations, which is how most of them were going in anyway.
//
// What is left here reads and removes. Nothing writes a new one, and nothing
// deletes what exists: a reservation still carrying components shows them
// read only until somebody clears them, because a confirmation number on
// somebody's air is worth more than a tidy screen.
