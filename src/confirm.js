// Reading a vendor confirmation instead of retyping it.
//
// Booking a cruise produces a confirmation email with every fact the portal
// wants: the number, the ship, the dates, the cabin, the guests, the money.
// The advisor then types all of it in again from the other window. That
// retyping is the friction that decides whether a CRM gets used at all, and
// it is the one thing every advisor does after every booking.
//
// Deliberately a reader, not an importer. It fills a form and stops. Vendor
// confirmations have no standard shape, so this will misread some of them,
// and a parser that writes a reservation straight to the database on a guess
// is worse than typing: a wrong sail date somebody corrected is a nuisance, a
// wrong sail date nobody saw is a missed holiday.
//
// So every field comes back with the line it was read from, and the page
// shows both. The advisor is confirming what was read, not trusting it.
