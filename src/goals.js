// today to be on track, and whether you are ahead or behind that. Everything
// here exists to answer that second question.

// The basis is stored with the goal. "Sell $200,000 this year" means one thing
// counted by when reservations were taken and another counted by when people
// travel, and those can differ by a whole quarter. Purchase is the default
// because it measures what you did rather than what is arriving.
