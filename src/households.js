// their own passport, their own trips. A household is the fact that two of
// those rows are married, which the portal had no way to know.
//
// The reason it earns its place is the reservation. Put one of them on a
// booking and the rest of the house is offered as travellers, with the name,
// the email, the phone and the date of birth already known. That is the second
// name on nearly every leisure booking, typed from memory today.
//
// A household groups people and owns nothing else. Trips, credits and tasks
// stay on the client, so somebody who moves out takes their history with them
// and dissolving a household leaves every client exactly where they were.
