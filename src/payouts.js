// What the agency actually paid the advisor.
//
// The last step of the money, and the one the portal had nothing for. It
// could say what a vendor owed, what the vendor had paid, and what the
// advisor was owed out of it, and then stopped. So the payout run was a list
// that looked identical on the 15th and the 30th, and the only record that
// somebody had been paid was a bank statement and somebody's memory.
//
// The same shape as the vendor half in reconcile.js, deliberately. Money
// expected, money arrived, and the gap between them is the thing worth
// looking at; here it is the advisor's share of what arrived, what has gone
// out to them, and the gap. One payment covers many reservations, and what
// makes it a record rather than a number is knowing which.
//
// Only an owner writes one. An advisor who could record a payout could
// declare themselves paid, which is the same class of hole as an advisor
// setting their own split, and that one was real.
