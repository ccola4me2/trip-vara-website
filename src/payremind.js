// Telling the client the money is due, before it is.
//
// The reminder was already written and already worked; it was a button. An
// advisor with forty live bookings presses it when they remember to, which is
// the failure the portal exists to fix. This is the same email on a schedule.
//
// Four decisions worth stating, because each is the kind that gets reversed by
// accident later:
//
//   - Hard payments only. The scheduler creates a soft row ahead of every
//     vendor deadline as the advisor's own buffer, for the same money, at the
//     distance SOFT_DAYS sets in payments.js. Sending both would tell the
//     client twice about one payment.
//   - Three weeks, one week, one day, then once when it is late. Different
//     messages about the same payment, so the column tracks how close the last
//     one was rather than whether any went at all.
//   - Nothing is sent for a payment the advisor has already reminded about by
//     hand today. Two notices an hour apart reads as a system with nobody
//     driving it.
//   - Off until turned on, per advisor. This sends email to their clients over
//     their name, which nobody should inherit by default.
