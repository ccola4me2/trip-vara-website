// Reconciling commission: what the vendor paid against what was expected.
//
// The old model had one figure and a tickbox. Marking a reservation paid meant
// the report counted the full expected commission, whether or not that is what
// arrived. Vendors pay short. They pay late, they pay a base rate and hold the
// bonus, they net off a chargeback from six months ago, and none of that was
// visible in a system where "paid" was a state rather than an amount.
//
// So money received is recorded as its own rows. Expected commission still
// lives on the reservation, received is the sum of the receipts against it, and
// the difference between the two is the number worth looking at. A reservation
// is settled when the money has actually arrived, not when somebody said so.
//
// Statements exist because that is how vendors pay: one payment covering many
// reservations, with a list. The statement total is entered from the vendor's
// own document and the lines are matched to reservations underneath it. When
// the matched lines and the stated total agree, the statement is reconciled.
// When they do not, the gap is either a line nobody has matched yet or money
// the vendor has not actually sent, and both are worth knowing.
