// The page a client can open.
//
// Everything this portal knows about a trip stopped at the advisor's screen.
// The client got a PDF in an email and, three weeks later, asked what they had
// paid and when the balance was due, because the answer was in an inbox rather
// than anywhere they could look. This is that answer, on a link.
//
// Read only, deliberately, and there is nothing to pay here even in principle:
// the client pays the supplier, and the money never passes through the agency.
// The schedule on this page is a record of what the supplier is owed and when,
// not an invoice from the advisor. Saying that plainly matters, because a page
// that lists amounts and due dates without saying who they are paid to reads
// like a bill from whoever's name is at the top.
//
// A client can see what is booked, what is paid, what is due and which options
// were offered; they cannot accept or change anything. What they can do is say
// something, which lands as a message on the reservation and an email to the
// advisor, because "tell me" only works if telling you is easier than not
// bothering.
//
// Three things it must never show, and the reason each is easy to leak:
//   - Commission. It sits on the booking, on every pricing line, and on the
//     agent confirmation PDF the importer reads.
//   - The price breakdown. Every kind is a real charge the client pays, but
//     one of them is called Mark up, and a page that lists it is a page that
//     starts an argument. The total and the schedule are what a client needs.
//   - Passport numbers. Travellers carry them; this shows names.

 * say no was to reply to an email, and most people do not reply: they stop
 * opening it. The proposal then sat in "Opened, no answer" for ever, which is
 * the advisor's follow-up list, so the follow-up list slowly filled with
 * people who had already decided.
 *
 * Behind the same switch as choosing. A quote the advisor has not opened for
 * answers cannot be declined either, because a client saying no to something
 * still being written is answering a question nobody asked yet.
 *
 * The reason is optional and free text. A dropdown would have to guess the
 * choices, and "too much", "the dates moved" and "we booked with my sister's
 * friend" are three completely different next moves for the advisor, only one
 * of which is a lost client.
