// `advisor_split_pct` is the percentage the booking advisor keeps. The agency
// keeps the rest. A reservation with no split recorded falls back to the
// advisor's standing agreement, and an advisor with no standing agreement
// keeps all of it.
//
// NULL is not zero, and this is the whole reason the module exists. No split
// agreed means the advisor keeps what they earned; a deliberate 0 means the
// agency keeps everything, which is a real arrangement for a house account.
// `pct || 100` collapses one into the other and silently pays somebody.

/**
 * The commission the agency takes no share of, whatever the split says.
 *
 * A tour conductor credit and a vendor bonus are not earned by the agency's
 * terms with the vendor; they are earned by the advisor filling a group or
 * hitting a target, and the agreement here is that they keep the lot. A casino
 * deal is the exception, which is why there are two bonus kinds rather than a
 * rule: running casino rates through the agency is using the agency's licence
 * and its risk, so that one is split like anything else.
 *
 * Kept in this module rather than with the other commission kinds because
 * pricing.js imports db.js which imports this, and the list has to sit at the
 * bottom of the pile for both sides to read it.
