// Who has asked not to be emailed, and the link that lets them ask.
//
// Two rules run through this file and they are easy to get backwards.
//
// A marketing email is one somebody could reasonably not want: a newsletter, a
// deal, a drip to a list. Those check the suppression list, carry an
// unsubscribe link, and carry a postal address, because that is what the law
// asks for and what a spam filter looks for.
//
// A transactional email is about something the person already has: their
// quote, their invoice, their payment falling due next Tuesday. Those are not
// suppressed and do not carry an unsubscribe link, because offering to stop
// sending somebody their own payment reminders is not a kindness, and because
// mixing the two is how a genuine service email ends up unsent.
//
// The distinction is the caller's to make, and it is stated at every send
// rather than inferred here. Inferring it would mean guessing, and the cost of
// guessing wrong in one direction is a fine and in the other is a client who
// never hears that their balance is due.
