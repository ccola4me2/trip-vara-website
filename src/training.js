// The whole portal, in the order somebody would learn it.
//
// The first version of this was nine lessons covering the path to a first
// booking. That is the right thing for a first morning and the wrong thing
// for everything after it: it walked past Group space, Proposals out, Who to call,
// Automations and twenty other screens, so an advisor
// who finished it still did not know what the portal could do. Most of the
// portal was being paid for and not used.
//
// So this is the whole surface, grouped the way the navigation is grouped,
// because the order somebody learns in should match the order they will later
// look things up in. Your first week still comes first and still builds one
// real reservation. After that each section covers its screens: what it is,
// when you would use it, and the thing people get wrong.
//
// Every lesson names a section of the manual and a page to do the work on,
// and scripts/check-training.mjs checks both against the real files, so a
// renamed section or a moved page fails the build rather than leaving a new
// advisor on a page that does not exist.
//
// Still not a test. Nothing is scored and nothing is timed. The ticks exist
// so somebody can stop on Tuesday and pick up on Thursday, and so an owner
// can tell a stuck advisor from a busy one.
//
// The rules that are not discoverable by clicking live on the cheat sheet at
// /app/cheatsheet rather than here: the ninety day trap, how a split is
// resolved, which figures exclude what. A lesson can send somebody there, but
// a rule somebody needs while on the phone should not be four clicks inside a
// course.
